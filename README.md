Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a fascinating field that aims to bridge the gap between human communication and computers. Our project leverages the power of machine learning to solve various NLP tasks, and this README will guide you through the project's details.

Project Overview
In this project, we tackle a variety of NLP challenges, including but not limited to:

Sentiment Analysis
Named Entity Recognition
Language Translation
Text Generation
We have developed multiple machine learning models and tools to address these tasks effectively.

Getting Started
To get started with our project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-machine-learning-project.git
Set up your Python environment by running:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore our various NLP models and notebooks in the models directory.

For specific instructions on running and training models, refer to the model-specific READMEs in their respective directories.

Project Structure
Our project is organized as follows:

data/: Contains datasets and preprocessing scripts.
models/: Includes the code for various NLP models.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model evaluation.
results/: Stores the results of our experiments.
scripts/: Helpful scripts for data processing and other utilities.
Model Training
We have developed and fine-tuned several NLP models using state-of-the-art techniques. You can find detailed instructions for training and evaluating these models in the models/ directory.
